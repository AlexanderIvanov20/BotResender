# BotResender
Bot that resend message (with images and other args) from telegram chat to window on site

It is necessary to organize the output of the latest messages (the number is set) from your Telegram group/channel to your website.
Come up with an interesting message display design.
There must be (and also disabled) a button to join the group.

HTML site https://bursnab.by there is already a paid widget, but it's kind of clumsy.
I would like messages to be displayed in this way https://bursnab.by/tel.php this code is simple there is a loop under the message-id from 1300 to 1100.
But in this case, nonexistent or deleted messages come across. In general, I want the output to work stably with its design.
This is how messages from the channel https://t.me/s/doloteam/ are displayed as standard, I would like to do it on my site, so that there is either a channel or a group.
